        <br>
        <br>


        <h3>DENTAL TRAUMA</h3>
        <p>Dental trauma involving a lost tooth is a dental emergency! If your permanent tooth falls out of your mouth due to injury, Dr. Plotnick suggests to gently clean off the root, if still in tact, and try to replace it in the socket in the appropriate
            orientation as soon as possible. If you can replace the tooth within 30 minutes, research shows a much higher percentage of keeping your original tooth! Other tips include storing the tooth in saliva (like in your cheek), or milk. You should
            not wait over two hours to be seen by a dental professional.</p>

        <h3>BLEEDING GUMS</h3>
        <p>If your gums are spontaneously bleeding, yet you have regular cleanings and checkups, this is a dental emergency. Please visit your medical doctor immediately to check the status of your health, and let Dr. Plotnick at Grand Street Dental know
            as soon as possible. Bleeding gums could be a symptom of more serious health conditions.</p>

        <h3>BROKEN CUSP OF A MOLAR</h3>
        <p>Unless you’re in extreme pain, a broken cusp of a molar is not a dental emergency. For these cases, we will book you at our next available spot.</p>
